# Firebase Asynchronous Data Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to asynchronous operations when fetching data from the Firebase Realtime Database. The `bug.js` file contains code that incorrectly handles data fetching, potentially leading to errors due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by properly handling the asynchronous data fetching using promises or async/await to ensure data is available before processing.

## Problem
The problem lies in attempting to use the fetched data before it's fully loaded from the database, which may result in undefined errors.  This is because Firebase's `once()` method is asynchronous; the data isn't immediately available.

## Solution
The solution ensures the data is fetched successfully before using it. This is achieved by using `.then()` (promise) to guarantee that the `displayUserData` function only executes after the Firebase data is received.
